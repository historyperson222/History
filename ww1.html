<br>
<h4> 
It was sparked by the assasination of the Austrio-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife sophie in Sarajevo. <br>
They were assasinated by a member of the Black Hand Gang called Gavrillo Princip. The Austro-Hungarian Govenment blamed the Serbian Government for the assasination of the Archduke.<br>
They then invaded and Germany supported them as they were allies. Russia then declared war on Germany and Astria-Hungary in defense of Serbia. That then bought Frane into the war as they had an alliance with Britain and Russia called the Triple Entente. The German alliance was calle the Triple Alliance and had Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, who later swiched sides.<br>
