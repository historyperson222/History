    <h1>World War I - The First World War</h1>
    <h4>
      The First World War, also known as World War I, was a global conflict that took place from July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918.
      <br><br>
      It was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo. This event was carried out by a member of the Black Hand Gang named Gavrilo Princip. Austria-Hungary blamed the Serbian government for the assassination, leading to their invasion. Germany supported Austria-Hungary as their allies. Russia entered the war in defense of Serbia, followed by France, which had alliances with Britain and Russia, forming the Triple Entente. Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (which later switched sides) formed the Triple Alliance.

      The Map of Alliances in 1914
      <br><br>
      When Germany invaded Belgium, Britain, although part of the Triple Entente, entered the war because of their alliance with Belgium. The British Army joined the conflict in France, where they eventually dug trenches along with the opposing forces, leading to a war of attrition. In July 1918, the Allies launched a significant counteroffensive following the German Spring Offensive.
